# CCGVault

CCGVault is a web and possible mobile application that provides any and all card game collector a way to keep track of their collection of cards and checks the current market value of the collection. The app will hold a database of cards and check the market value from TCGplayer.com. CCGVault will let you add cards to your collection, and remove them as needed. It will keep track of the duplicate amounts as well!
Iâ€™ll create this application using Spring, Java, SQL, and React.
